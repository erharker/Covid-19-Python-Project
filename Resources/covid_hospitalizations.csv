Disclaimer:
The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET)
hospitalization data are preliminary and subject to change as more data become available. In
"particular, case counts and rates for recent hospital admissions are subject to lag. As data are"
"received each week, prior case counts and rates are updated accordingly.  COVID-NET conducts"
population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed COVID-19-associated hospitalizations in
children (less than 18 years of age) and adults. COVID-NET covers nearly 100 counties in the 10
"Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, TN) and four"
"Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IHSP) states (IA, MI, OH, and UT). Cumulative and"
"weekly unadjusted incidence rates (per 100,000 population) are calculated using the National Center"
for Health Statistics' (NCHS) vintage 2018 bridged-race postcensal population estimates for the
counties included in the surveillance catchment area. The rates provided are likely to be
underestimated as COVID-19-associated hospitalizations might be missed due to test availability and
provider or facility testing practices.
